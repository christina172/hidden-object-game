This is a project to learn Firebase - to store the players and their scores in Cloud Firestore.

This is a hidden object game, where the player needs to find 14 hidden objects. When the player clicks the image, a dropdown list with the option appears on the screen. If the player selects the correct option a green border will appear around the found object. When the player has found all of the hidden objects, he can submit his score and name. The 20 best scores are displayed at the bottom of the page.
